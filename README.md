Description:
A partial view of traffic violation tickets from São Caetano do Sul, from the years 2020 and 2021, was obtained by reading PDFs from the City's Official Gazette (Diário Oficial), published biweekly when posting violations. The raw data is stored in a MySQL database, originally created to display information on the website https://cidadeemnumeros.com.br.
